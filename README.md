claferMPS
=========

##### v0.4.3

JetBrains Meta-Programming System (MPS)  support for Clafer.

[Clafer](http://clafer.org) is a general-purpose lightweight structural modeling language developed by
[GSD Lab](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/), [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca), and
[MODELS](http://www.itu.dk/research/models/) group at [IT University of Copenhagen](http://www.itu.dk/).
Clafer can be used for modeling of static hierarchical structures but has no support for modeling the change of the structures over time (behavior).
The main goal of Clafer is to make modeling more accessible to a wider range of users and domains.

Features
--------

ClaferMPS consists of two languages: Clafer and Architecture DSL. The latter extends Clafer with automotive concepts from a reference model for early architecture exploration used in [case studies by Jordan Ross](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/node/668) (models from these case studies are available for download).

* Clafer 0.4.3
   * a smart structured editor with autocompletion and many intentions,
   * type system,
   * module system,
   * generator of plain-text Clafer.
* Architecture DSL
   * based on a reference model which is an adaptation of EAST-ADL, including technical feature model, functional analysis architecture, hardware design architecture, and separate functional to hardware architecture deployment specification (details in [technical report](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/publications/view/667)),
   * separate definition of quality attributes,
   * editable textual and graphical projections,
   * semantic error checking according to the reference model,
   * generation of plain Clafer separate for every module with and without the quality attributes.

Planned Features
----------------

* integration of the backend reasoners and display of the results as textual or graphical models

Installation
------------

1. [JetBrains Meta Programming System (MPS)](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/download/) v3.3.5 (build 143.1301).
    * On Windows, install MPS to a location without spaces, e.g., `c:\Programs\MPS3.3`
    * *Important*, start and close MPS before proceeding to step 2.
2. [mbeddr](http://mbeddr.com/)
    * Follow the [instructions](http://mbeddr.com/download.html); however, you may skip "Gcc, Make and Gdb", "Graphviz", "Verification Tools" sections
        * Proceed to "mbeddr Source Installation"
            * in some `<target directory>`, clone `mbeddr.core` repository using `git clone https://github.com/mbeddr/mbeddr.core.git --depth 10 -b stable` to avoid downloading the complete history
            * in the `build.properties` file, always use `/`, even on Windows. For example, `mps.home=c:/Programs/MPS3.3`.
        * For the `Global Libraries` settings, add two libraries
            * `mbeddr.core=<target directory>/code/languages`
            * `mbeddr.plugins=<target directory>/code/plugins`
3. In some `<target directory>`, execute
    * `git clone https://github.com/gsdlab/claferMPS.git`
4. Run MPS
5. `Open Project`
    * choose `<target directory>/claferMPS/code/languages/org.clafer.mps`
6. In the `Logical View`
    * r-click on `org.clafer.mps/core` and execute `Rebuid Project` from the context menu
    * r-click on `org.clafer.mps/architecture` and execute `Rebuid Project` from the context menu

Opening the automotive case studies
-----------------------------------

1. Download [`CaseStudies.zip`](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/sites/default/files/CaseStudies.zip) and unzip to some `<models directory>`.
2. In MPS, while having ClaferMPS project opened
    * `File->Open`
    * select `<models directory>/CaseStudies`
    * choose `New Window` in the dialog `Open Project`
3. Open `PowerWindow/PowerWindow/DriverDoor/DriverWinSysFAA`.
4. Select `Projection/E/E Architecture Diagrams` to switch to a diagrammatic view.

Update
------

1. To update mbeddr, execute
    * `cd <target directory>/mbeddr.core`
    * `git pull`
    * `cd code/languages`
    * `./buildLanguages.sh`  (or `.\buildLanguages.bat` on Windows)
2. To update ClaferMPS, execute
    * `cd <target directory>/claferMPS`
    * `git pull`

Perform `Rebuild` as in step 6. of the installation.

Usage
-----

MPS is a projectional editor and it requires some getting used to.
In particular, the process of editing the model is more structured and guided by the syntax and the type system of the language then compared to more traditional plain text editing.
We highly recommend viewing videos and going through basic usage tutorials on the [MPS's website](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/).

ClaferMPS is also built on top of [mbeddr](http://mbeddr.com/) and we recommend viewing the many materials available there.

Once the project `org.clafer.mps` is successfully built, Clafer and the Architecture DSL become two of the many languages available within MPS and mbeddr.

### Creating a new solution

When creating a new solution in MPS, developers must explicitly choose which languages they will be using.

* click on `Create New Project` or `File->New->Project`
    * choose `solution project` because we want to use existing languages and not create new ones
* select your project and in `Logical View` and select `File->Settings`
    * in the search box, type `global libraries` and click on the found settings section
    * Click on `Add`, type `ClaferMPS` and point to `<target directory>/claferMPS/code/languages/`
* r-click on your solution and select `New->Model` (not the `New model` command from mbeddr)
    * in the model properties dialog, click on `Used languages` tab and click on `+`
    * add `org.clafer` and `org.clafer.architecture`

Now you are ready to create the contents of the model.

### Using Clafer

In the Logical View, r-click on your model and select `New->o.clafer.core->ClafeModule`. Give it a name and no imports. Use `<tab>` and `<shift>+<tab>` to navigate between name, imports, and the body of the module.

In the body of the module, type

* `BobTheBuilder` - to declare a clafer named Bob
* `<enter>` - to go to the next line
* `Alice`
* `<enter>`
* `<tab>` - to indent to be able to create a nested clafer
* `likes`
* `<space>` - to add another part of clafer declaration
* `->` - make it a reference
* `Bob` - give the type of the reference
* `<ctrl>+<space>` - to complete the name

In general, use `<ctrl>+<space>` for context-dependent completion.
When declaring a clafer, use `<space>` to move to the next part of clafer definition: it could be a supertype, a reference type, or a multiplicity.

Now, let's change `BobTheBuilder` into an abstract clafer `Person`.

* Place the cursor on `BobTheBuilder` and edit the name to `Person`; observe that the target of the reference `likes` was also updated.
* Press `<alt>+<enter>` to invoke intention menu and select `Make abstract`. Intentions are predefined editing actions.

Now, we want `Alice` to extend from `Person`.

* Place the cursor at the end of `Alice`, type `<space>` followed by `:` to enter a supertype and write `Per` + `<ctrl>+<space>` and select `Person` from the list.

Now, we want Alice to be able to be able to like many people, not just one. We need to change the multiplicity of the clafer `likes`.

* Place the cursor on `likes` and press `<alt>+<enter>`, select `Multiplicity *`.

Let's give Alice a subclafer `name` which appears before `likes`.

* Place the cursor on `likes` and press `<shift>+<enter>`.
* Enter a clafer `name -> string`.
* Press `<alt>+<enter>`, select `Add an Initializer`, type `"Alice"`.

You can navigate among the syntactical element by pressing `<ctrl>+<arrow>`. Press `<ctrl>+<right arrow>` until you reach the end of line marker furthest to the right. Press `<enter>` to create an empty line after the entire clafer `Alice`.

Now, you can add more clafers.

* Enter a clafer `Bob : Person`.

Finally, write a constraint that Alice likes Bob.

* Create an empty line after the entire clafer `Bob`.
* Type `[`.
* Type `Alice.likes = Bob`.

### Using Architecture DSL

The Architecture DSL is an extension of Clafer. Let's create a simple architecture for a simple model car.

We begin with a feature model.

* In an empty line, press `<ctrl>+<space>` and select `Feature Model`.
* Type `CarFM`, press `<space>` and `{` to add content.
* Inside, press `<ctrl>+<space>` and select `Feature`, type `DualMotor`, `<enter>`.
* Press `<ctrl>+<space>` and select `Feature`, type `ObstacleAvoidance`, `<alt>+<enter>`, select `Make Optional`, `<enter>`.

Next, we create a functional analysis architecture.

* In an empty line, press `<ctrl>+<space>` and select `Functional Analysis`.
* Type `CarFAA`, press `<space>` and `{` to add content.
* Inside, press `<ctrl>+<space>` and select `Functional Device`, type `LeftMotor`, `<ctrl>+d`.
* Rename the copy to `RightMotor`, `<enter>`.
* Press `<ctrl>+<space>` and select `Functional Device`, type `ProximitySensor`, select `Make Optional`, `<enter>`.
* Press `<ctrl>+<space>` and select `Analysis Function`, type `MotionController`, `<enter>`.
* Press `<ctrl>+<space>` and select `Function Connector`, type `obstacle`, `<tab>`, type `ProximitySensor`, `<tab>`, type `MotionController`, `<enter>`.
* Click on `obstacle` and make the connector Optional.
* Create two connectors from the `MotionController` to each motor.
* Add a constraint `[some obstacle <=> some ProximitySensor]`.

Now, let's switch to a diagrammatic representation and inspect our functional architecture visually.

* select `Projection->E/E Architecture Diagrams`.

You will see a diagram for `CarFAA` (there's no diagram for feature models).

* Press `Auto layout diagram` in the top-left corner.

Here's the resulting model in ClaferMPS. The source code for this sample project is available in [SampleProject/Project1.zip]().

![End Result](SampleProject/SampleProject.png)

There are many more architectural layers (hardware, including devices, communication and power topologies, deployment of functional analysis architecture to hardware design architecture, and quality perspectives). We encourage users to study the two large case studies created by Jordan Ross highlighted in the next section.

### Larger Case Studies

For details about full size power window (single and two door) and door locks case studies, see [technical report](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/publications/view/667) and [`CaseStudies.zip`](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/sites/default/files/CaseStudies.zip).
