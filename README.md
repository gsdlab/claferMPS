##### v0.4.3

Meta-Programming System support for Clafer

[Clafer](http://clafer.org) is a general-purpose lightweight structural modeling language developed by
[GSD Lab](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/), [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca), and
[MODELS](http://www.itu.dk/research/models/) group at [IT University of Copenhagen](http://www.itu.dk/).
Clafer can be used for modeling of static hierarchical structures but has no support for modeling the change of the structures over time (behavior).
The main goal of Clafer is to make modeling more accessible to a wider range of users and domains.

Features
--------

ClaferMPS consists of two languages: Clafer and Architecture DSL, which extends Clafer in MPS.

* Clafer 0.4.3
   * a smart structured editor with autocompletion and many intentions,
   * type system,
   * module system,
   * generator of plain-text Clafer,
* An Architecture DSL
   * based on a reference model which is an adaptation of EAST-ADL, including technical feature model, functional analysis architecture, hardware design architecture, and separate functional to hardware architecture deployment specification (details in [technical report](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/publications/view/667)),
   * separate definition of quality attributes,
   * editable textual and graphical projections,
   * semantic error checking according to the reference model,
   * generation of plain Clafer separate for every module with and without the quality attributes.

Planned Features
----------------

* integration of the backend reasoners and display of the results as textual or graphical models

Installation
------------

1. [JetBrains Meta Programming System (MPS)](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/download/) v3.3.5 (build 143.1301).
    * *Important*, start and close MPS before proceeding to step 2.
2. [mbeddr](http://mbeddr.com/)
    * Follow the [instructions](http://mbeddr.com/download.html); however, you may skip "Gcc, Make and Gdb", "Graphviz", "Verification Tools" sections
        * proceed to "mbeddr Source Installation"
        * do not set the `Global Libraries` setting, it will result in errors when building ClaferMPS
        * in some `<target directory>`, clone `mbeddr.core` repository using `git clone https://github.com/mbeddr/mbeddr.core.git --depth 10` to avoid downloading the complete history
3. in some `<target directory>`, execute
    * `git clone https://github.com/gsdlab/claferMPS.git`
4. run MPS
5. `Open Project`
    * choose `<target directory>/claferMPS/code/languages/org.clafer.mps`
6. in the `Logical View`, r-click on `org.clafer.mps` and execute `Rebuid Project` from the context menu

Update
------

1. to update mbeddr, execute
    * `cd <target directory>/mbeddr.core`
    * `git pull`
    * `cd code/languages`
    * `./buildLanguages.sh`  (or `.\buildLanguages.bat` on Windows)
2. to update ClaferMPS, execute
    * `cd <target directory>/claferMPS`
    * `git pull`

Perform `Rebuild` as in step 6. of the installation

Usage
-----

MPS is a projectional editor and requires some getting used to.
In particular, the process of editing the model is more structured and guided by the syntax and the type system of the language then compared to more traditional plain text editing.
We highly recommend viewing videos and going through basic usage tutorials on the [MPS's website](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/).

ClaferMPS is also built on top of [mbeddr](http://mbeddr.com/) and we recommend viewing the many materials available there.

Once the project `org.clafer.mps` is successfully built, Clafer and the Automotive Architecture DSL become two of the many languages available within MPS and mbeddr.

### Using Plain Clafer

In the Logical View, navigate to `org.clafer.example` which is a sandbox solution containing some random Clafer models. Open one of the models `M1` and use arrows to navigate. The cursor will always be located in some syntactic unit (AST node), which gets highlighted.

Go to an empty line and begin typing `abst` + `<ctrl>+<space>` and select `abstract` from the list.
Now, a new clafer declaration was created.
Enter `Carol` for the name.

Press `<space>` to move to the next part of clafer definition: it could be a supertype, a reference type, or a multiplicity.
Type `:` to enter a supertype and write `Per` + `<ctrl>+<space>` and select `Person` from the list.

Press `<space>` to move to the next part of clafer definition: a reference type or a multiplicity.
Type `->` to enter a reference type and write `Alice`.

Press `<space>` to move to the next part of clafer definition: a multiplicity or an initializer.
Type `1` for multiplicity.

Press `<alt>+<enter>` to open a pop-up menu with the available `intentions`. Select `Add an initializer`. Type `Alice`.

Press `<enter>` to move to the next line and `<tab>` to begin entering a nested clafer.
Enter a clafer `name -> string = "Carol"`.

You can navigate among the syntactical element by pressing `<ctrl>+<arrow>`. Press `<ctrl>+<right arrow>` until you reach the end of line marker furthest to the right. Press `<enter>` to create an empty line after the entire clafer `Carol`.

This definition does not make much sense but it illustrates the editing process.

### Inspecting the concept definitions of the automotive architecture DSL

Expand the solution `ca.uwaterloo.gsd.PowerWindowSystem`. It contains two models:

1. `Architecture` which is a plain Clafer version of the model, and
2. `ArchitectureExt` which is a version of the model created using the Architecture DSL.

#### PowerWindowSystem in plain Clafer

Expand the model `Architecture` and inspect modules `EAST-ADL` and `AutomotiveConcepts`, which define the architecture DSL. The actual architecture created using these concepts begins with the module `S01_Technical_Feature_Model` followed by functional analysis and design.

For more information about this model and the EAST-ADL methodology, refer to Alexandr Murashkin's thesis [Automotive Electronic/Electric Architecture Modeling, Design Exploration and Optimization using Clafer](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/8780).

### Using Architecture DSL

#### PowerWindowSystem in Automotive Architecture DSL

Expand the model `examples/ca.uwaterloo.gsd.PowerWindowSystem/ArchitectureExt`. The plain Clafer modules `EAST-ADL` and `AutomotiveConcepts` remain the same because they are a library.

The folder `ArchitectureExt` contains modules expressed using the DSL. The DSL provides both textual and graphical syntaxes.

Open `S02_System_Architecture`, from the menu `Projection`, toggle `E/E Architecture Diagrams.

Inspect the remaining modules and compare the textual and graphical syntaxes.
